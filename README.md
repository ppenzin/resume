resume
======

My sample resume. Noticed that people are sharing resume sources via github, so
feel free to use to create yours from mine.

# Dependencies
* GNU Make (gmake) for building
* texlive (http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for LaTeX processing. `Official'
  version is recommended, since texlive that comes with your OS might not have
  up-to date packages.

# Building
Makefile is set to produce a PDF file via pdflatex. Teslive supports other
formats as well.
